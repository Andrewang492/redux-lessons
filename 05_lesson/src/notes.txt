Got rid of postAdded reducer, because adding post handled with async Thunks.

Remember that 'action creator functions' are the reducers in the reducer field of createSlice.

Created a counter to show performance things. React devtools Profiler. When you record, it shows what renders.
You may find that other elements are rendering which is not appropriate.
-- The issue was that posts for a user were refreshing each time counter incremented, even though unrelated.
useSelector runs everytime action is dispatched - including increasecounter dispatch. And since it would return a new value (the .filter on an array will return a new array, even though with same contents), it requires a new render.

Can also stop components from rerendering by saying ComponentName = React.memo(ComponentName). Will only change if props becomes different.

Normalisation however is recommended - You do not duplicate data, create an ID lookup for items.
CreateEntityAdapater API. This abstracts more logic from componenets, builtin crud methods, automatic selector generation.
For all of the cases and reducers that change state, use new adapter methods.
We can automatically get 
    selectAll, selectById, selectIds,
then give them names, instead of writing the seelctors ourselves.

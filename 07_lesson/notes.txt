switched from using the public jsonplaceholder api to using json-server (used in 06). No more thunks, axios.
Changed getSelector call, something because of how the reutrn from getPosts is not the data alone.

Now we have stopped using a lot of dispatches in many components - addpostform, editpostform - and used the api.

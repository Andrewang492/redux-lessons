same project as lesson 5.

switched from using the public jsonplaceholder api to using json-server (used in 06). No more thunks, axios.
Completely revamp postsSlice. You need to write injectEndpoints instead.
Change the store as well.
Changed getSelector call, something because of how the reutrn from getPosts is not the data alone.

Now we have stopped using a lot of dispatches in many components - addpostform, editpostform - and used the api.

npm install the redux/toolkit and react-redux
create app/store.js and import into index.js
Then import Provider from react-redux to wrap around the App component.

Store is just exporting the configureStore.


Slices are where you divide up your state. Create a slice, and import the reducer into the store.js.

UseSelector always selects by you giving a function that depends on state, and you doing returning soemthing from it.

New data/features (adding reactions feature) you go change postsSlice. Change initial state, prepare().
